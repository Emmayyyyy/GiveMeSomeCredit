# GiveMeSomeCredit
This project uses Kaggle's data (Give Me Some Credit) and aims to do credit scoring and predict default chance.
We first start out with data cleaning (TrainingDataCleaning.ipynb, TestDataCleaning.ipynb).
Then we use several models and evaluate their performance with selected measures.
Models used in this project include logistic regression, CART, Neural Network, tree models and boosting models.
